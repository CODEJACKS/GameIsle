<h1>“I hope you guys know that anything in life can be wrong, or said wrong, or seen wrongly, but all you have to do is accept that you make mistakes and know that<br> 
YOU ARE HUMAN, YOU ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING MISTAKES, BUT YOU ARE ALSO CAPABLE OF TRYING AGAIN<br>
So, try as many times as you need, we’re kids, we have all the time we need.<br>
And now I leave this with you in confidence that this inspirational message got to you and you can all get this into your brains and can remember this.”
